Notebooks are written in Python using [Pyvisa](https://pyvisa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) and [nidaqmx](https://nidaqmx-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) libraries to communicate with instruments in the lab. Instruments are connected through GPIB, USB, RS 232 or ethernet ports. One can use graphical programming like Labview to do the same.
